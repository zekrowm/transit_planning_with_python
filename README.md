# Transit Planning With Python

Transit Planning Tools for Medium-Sized Agencies

Welcome to **Transit Planning With Python**, a toolkit of off‚Äëthe‚Äëshelf Python scripts designed for data‚Äëdriven transit planning at medium‚Äësized agencies. Each tool focuses on accomplishing a common task or solving a common challenge in transit analysis and planning. The most common input is static ***General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)*** data, but shapefile roadway centerlines, roadway polygons, bus route shapes, Census blocks, and others are also commonly used.

## üöÄ Features

Our scripts automate complex transit analysis. The current modules and data types supported include:

Data Preparation and Visualization

- ***Ridership Maps:*** Automate the processing of ridership, stop, and area data for use in heatmaps.
- ***Choropleth Data:*** Generate ready-to-map data for ridership trends and demographic overlays.

Operational Analysis

- ***Bus Bay Conflict Optimization:*** Identify scheduling conflicts and suggest improved assignments to reduce them.
- ***Headway and Schedule Analysis:*** Automatically calculate headways, span, and trip frequencies for any schedule.

Fieldwork Tools

- ***On-Site Checklists:*** Create field checklists for monitoring on-time performance and ridership at stops or while riding routes.

Network Analysis

- ***Route Identification:*** Quickly find transit routes operating near a defined point.
- ***Isochrone and Accessibility*** Mapping: Build transit and roadway networks to analyze travel times and service coverage.

GTFS Validation and Export

- ***GTFS Location and Name Validation:*** Cross-check GTFS stop and route data against standard shapefiles like roadway_centerlines.shp and bus_routes.shp.
- ***Schedule Export:*** Export transit schedules directly to Excel (.xlsx) format for sharing and reporting.

Demographic Analysis

- ***Census Integration:*** Process and combine Census tables with shapefiles for demographic insights.
- ***Service Population Analysis:*** Calculate residential and employee populations served by individual transit routes and systems.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized for ease of use, with:

- ***Standalone scripts:*** Each tool is fully documented with comments explaining field name assumptions, file formats, and usage instructions.
- ***Standard data formats:*** Most scripts are designed to work with commonly used data types like GTFS files and shapefiles. Specific requirements are outlined in the script comments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Common libraries like pandas, geopandas, rapidfuzz, networkx, and others listed in requirements.txt.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use

The **transit_planning_with_python** tools are designed to work on most systems with Python installed. Here are some key considerations based on your setup:
1. **Work PC with ArcPro Installed:**
   - If ArcPro is installed, libraries such as `arcpy` and other useful dependencies are already included.
   - However, your organization may restrict the installation of additional libraries like `geopandas` or `rapidfuzz`.
   - If unrestricted, note that `geopandas` conflicts with `arcpy`, so you will need to create a separate Python environment to use it.
2. **Home Computer with Python Installed:**
   - On a personal system, you can install Python and any libraries using `pip` without organization restrictions.
   - Keep in mind that `arcpy` is unavailable outside of ArcPro/ArcMap environments, so certain features relying on `arcpy` won't work.

Where possible, we will provide both `arcpy` and `geopandas` versions of geospatial scripts to accomodate these different setups.

### üñ•Ô∏è Option A: Using Python on a Work Computer with ArcPro

1. **Open a Notebook**
   - If ArcPro is installed on your computer, then Python is as well.
   - You can launch ArcPro and then open, create, or save a Notebook file (.ipynb) within that program.
   - You can also find "Jupyter Notebook" like any other program on your computer. Clicking it will open your default browser with the notebook interface.
   - Alternately, you can run this command in the Command Prompt to launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

2. **Get the Script(s) You Need**
   - Navigate to scripts that are useful to you and your agency. Then copy and paste their contents into an active notebook file or download them        as .py files. You do not need a GitHub account to do this.
   - Alternately, you can clone or download the whole repository from GitHub.
 
3. **Run the Script**
   - Confirm that desired code is present in notebook file and locate "CONFIGURATION" section.
   - "Update file paths:" At a minimum, you will need to update the folder and file paths to point to your data and specify where to save any
     output. There may also be additional configuration choices (e.g. choice of CRS, list of routes or stops to analyze)
   - You do not need to modify any code outside of the configuration section, which contains the core script logic.
   - Run the script, follow any printed instructions or error messages, and check the output for reasonableness and/or accuracy.

### ‚ùì What is Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter Notebook is a powerful tool for running Python scripts in an interactive environment that opens in your web browser (or within ArcPro). It allows you to write, test, and visualize Python code in a user-friendly way.

### üè° Option B: Setting Up Python on a Home Computer

1. **Download and Install Python**
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python 3.9 or later.
   - During installation, ensure you check the option to **"Add Python to PATH"**. This step is crucial for the command-line tools to work correctly.

2. **Install JupyterLab and Required Libraries**
   - Open the Command Prompt (search for "cmd" in your Start menu) and run the following command:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyterlab pandas geopandas shapely matplotlib networkx openpyxl rapidfuzz pulp
     ```
   - Wait for the installation to complete. If you see warnings about scripts not being on the PATH, don't worry - you can still use these tools.

3. **Launch JupyterLab**
   - After installation, search for "Command Prompt" and open it like any other program on your computer.
   - From the Command Prompt, type the following into the Command command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     jupyter lab
     ```
   - Once you have JupyterLab open in your web browser, you can browse your local files and create new notebook files.

4. **Get the Script(s) You Need**
   - Navigate to scripts that are useful to you and your agency. Then copy and paste their contents into an active notebook file or download them as .py files. You do not need a GitHub account to do this.
   - Alternately, you can clone or download the whole repository from GitHub.
 
5. **Run the Script**
   - Confirm that desired code is present in notebook file and locate "CONFIGURATION" section.
   - "Update file paths:" At a minimum, you will need to update the folder and file paths to point to your data and specify where to save any
     output. There may also be additional configuration choices (e.g. choice of CRS, list of routes or stops to analyze)
   - You do not need to modify any code outside of the configuration section, which contains the core script logic.
   - Run the script, follow any printed instructions or error messages, and check the output for reasonableness and/or accuracy.

## üí° Notes for Beginners

If you encounter any issues while installing Python or libraries, or if JupyterLab doesn't open as expected, here are some common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Python Installation**

   Open the Command Prompt and type:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

   If this command doesn't show a Python version (e.g., `Python 3.11.5`), Python may not be installed correctly, or it isn't added to your PATH. In that case:
   - Reinstall Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, ensure the option **"Add Python to PATH"** is checked.
   - Or proceed to **Step 3: Fixing PATH Issues**

2. **Check JupyterLab Installation**

   To confirm JupyterLab is installed, type:
     ```bash
     jupyter lab --version
     ```

   If this fails with an error like `'jupyter' is not recognized as an internal or external command`, JupyterLab is either not installed or the PATH variable isn't set correctly.  
   Try reinstalling JupyterLab by running:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyterlab
     ```

   If the issue persists, follow the steps in **Fixing PATH Issues** below.

3. **Fixing PATH Issues**

   If Python or Jupyter commands aren't recognized, you may need to manually add the Python Scripts directory to your PATH:

   - Locate the directory where Python installed its scripts. For most users, this will be:
        ```makefile
     C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python311\Scripts
     ```

   - Add this directory to your PATH:
      - Press <kbd>Win + S</kbd>, search for **Environment Variables**, and open **Edit the system environment variables**.
      - In the dialog, click **Environment Variables**.
      - Under **User variables**, find and edit the **Path** variable.
      - Add the Scripts directory to the list by clicking **New** and pasting the path above.

   - Restart your Command Prompt and verify by typing:
     ```bash
     jupyter lab --version
     ```   

4. **Reinstalling or Updating Pip**

   If the installation commands fail with errors like `pip is not recognized` or `ModuleNotFoundError`, try reinstalling or upgrading pip:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```   

5. **Alternative Way to Open JupyterLab**

   Instead of relying on PATH, you can directly use Python to run JupyterLab:
     ```bash
     python -m jupyter lab
     ```
     
   This bypasses PATH issues entirely.

By following these steps, you should have Python and the necessary tools ready to run your scripts efficiently. If you continue to face issues, feel free to consult the official documentation for [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
