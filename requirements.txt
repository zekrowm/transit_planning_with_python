# ------------- arcpy Library ------------------------------------------------
# Geospatial Libraries (ArcPy stack)
# Notes on ArcPy and Dual Geospatial Support
# This project supports two geospatial workflows:
#   1. ArcPy-based (requires ArcGIS Pro and its Python environment)
#   2. GeoPandas-based (open-source, fully pip-installable)
#
# ArcPy is not included here because it is not pip-installable.
# If using scripts that require ArcPy, run them within the ArcGIS Pro conda environment,
# which includes arcpy and most geospatial libraries by default.
