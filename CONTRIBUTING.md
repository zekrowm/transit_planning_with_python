# Contributing to This Repository

This project is built for transit planners, transit analysts, and civic technologists who want readable,
self-contained Python scripts for transportation planning. We value clarity, consistency, and usability
in our scripts to make them usable by a wider audience. Please follow the following principles when contributing:


## üß± Code Structure

- Scripts **must be modular**, with a clearly defined `main()` function.
- Include a clear **configuration section at the top** of each script.
  - Prefer inline variable configuration over `argparse`.
- Use intuitive success messages at the end of script execution.
  - e.g., `print("Script completed successfully.")` or equivalent `logging` call.
- Do **not import** functions from the shared `helpers/` directory at runtime.
  - Instead, **copy the relevant helper functions** into your script.
  - This keeps each script self-contained and easier for beginners to understand, run, and modify.
- The `helpers/` directory holds the **canonical version** of shared functions. Any differences between a script‚Äôs local copy and the canonical version will be flagged in CI.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime Behavior

- Prefer the `logging` module over `print()` for diagnostics or warnings.
- Implement **graceful, actionable error handling** ‚Äî no cryptic tracebacks.
- Use placeholder filenames that are clean, minimal, and safe to run (e.g., r"Path\\To\\Output_Folder", "input_data.csv").
- Default to:
  - **Washington, DC CRS** unless otherwise noted.
  - **Imperial units** (feet/miles), with metric options clearly noted when used.

## üß™ Testing & Review

- **Manual testing is required** before submitting a pull request. There are no automated tests yet.
- All commits must use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for clear project history.
- All pull requests are automatically tested for:
  - Style and formatting using `ruff`.
  - Static typing using `ty`.
- You **do not** need to run linters or type checkers manually, but you **must fix** any issues flagged by the CI pipeline before requesting a review.

## üßº Code Style

This project uses `ruff` to enforce formatting, linting, and docstring style, and `ty` for non-blocking type checks.

Most formatting issues (indentation, line length, spacing) are auto-corrected by Ruff on PRs.

- The following are enforced in CI:
  - PEP 8 layout and formatting
  - The enforced line length is **100 characters**
  - Google-style docstrings
  - Consistent import ordering (`isort`-compatible)
  - Type annotations (with some leniency for `Any`)
  - Avoiding `print()` (via Ruff rule `T201`) ‚Äî use `logging` instead        

**Note:** Ruff auto-fixes are pushed back to your PR branch automatically by the GitHub Actions workflow.

## üìÅ File Organization

- Add new scripts to the appropriate subfolder within `scripts/`, based on function (e.g., `ridership_tools/`, `gtfs_exports/`).
- If you create a helper that‚Äôs reused across multiple scripts:
  - Add the canonical version to the appropriate file under `helpers/`.
  - Then copy that helper into any script that uses it.
- Do **not** import functions from one script into another or from `helpers/` at runtime.
